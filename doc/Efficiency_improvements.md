Efficiency improvements for both `tf_broadcaster.cpp` and `process_data.cpp`.

### `tf_broadcaster.cpp`

The current implementation of `tf_broadcaster.cpp` is already quite efficient, with a complexity of \(O(1)\) per message. However, there are some best practices and minor optimizations that can be considered:

1. **Message Filtering**: If not all messages are relevant, you could add logic to filter out unnecessary messages earlier, reducing the amount of processing.

2. **Optimizing Subscription Queue Size**: Adjust the subscription queue size based on the rate of incoming messages and the processing capabilities of the node.

### `process_data.cpp`

The `process_data.cpp` implementation involves transforming and accumulating point clouds, which can be computationally expensive. Here are several improvements that can help optimize performance:

1. **Voxel Grid Filtering Before Accumulation**: 
   - Apply the voxel grid filter to the incoming point cloud before adding it to the accumulated point cloud. This reduces the number of points early, resulting in less data to process in subsequent steps.

2. **Efficient Data Structures**:
   - Use more efficient data structures for managing the accumulated point cloud. For instance, using spatial data structures (like k-d trees or octrees) can speed up operations that involve spatial queries and transformations.

4. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Utilize multi-threading or GPU acceleration for point cloud processing, especially for operations like transformations and voxel grid filtering, which can benefit significantly from parallel computation.

5. **Lazy Evaluation**:
   - Instead of immediately transforming and accumulating each incoming point cloud, store the raw point clouds and only process them when necessary (e.g., when publishing). This defers computation and can allow for more efficient bulk processing.

By applying these optimizations, the processing and accumulation of point cloud data can be made significantly more efficient, leading to better performance and responsiveness of the ROS node.
